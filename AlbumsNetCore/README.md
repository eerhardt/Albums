This is a C# / .NET 6 based version of the albums container.

Compilation and container creation can be done in Visual Studio.

The http test calls are exactly the same as in the albums project.
This is described in file testcalls.http.

The comparison of this container with the Go based container can be found in `../AlbumsGo`.
